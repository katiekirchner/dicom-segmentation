                Starting with a DICOM dataset of a 56 year old male patient from April 24, 2000, 
                first step involved extracting voxel data from the DICOM dataset.

                Iterating through each slice of the CT scans, each slice was translated into a NumPy 
                matrix and subsequently stored into a list containing a NumPy matrix representation of every 
                image in the DICOM series, and then convert into

              <p class="font paragraph-text">
                  From the extracted and converted data of all the scans, information such as the max, 
                  min, mean, standard deviation, and extreme values of the voxel data was then calculated.
                  With that, the next step was normalizing the data, by adjusting the values of the NumPy matrix 
                  and obtaining images with higher contrast and detail, shown in the adjacent image.
              </p>


              <p class="font paragraph-text">
                  With the data from each slice of the entire CT scan series represented as a normalized NumPy matrix, 
                  the next step was to run each CT slice through the segmentation process.

                Utilizing functionalities from the Skimage library, the segmentation process for
                each CT slice started with creating a threshold image from the original image. 
                To create the threshold image, a threshold value was determined by calculating the mean value 
                of the NumPy array, and then recreated the original image by representing each pixel as 
                either black represented as 0, or white represented as 1, contingent upon if the original 
                pixel value was greater than the threshold value.
            </p>

            <p class="font paragraph-text">
                After generating a threshold image, further processing to be cleaned was required,
                which was done by first eroding the image to remove anomalies and objects smaller than 
                the structuring element. After erosion, the threshold image was dilated, which filled 
                broken areas and created higher definition of borders.
            </p>

            <p class="font paragraph-text">
                With the cleaned threshold image, the next step was creating a distance map of the
                original image, which was done by calculating each non-zero, or non-background, pixelâ€™s distance from 
                to the nearest zero, or background. Next, an array containing the coordinates of local peaks 
                (maxima) by dilating the original image and merging neighboring local maxima closer than the 
                size of the dilation, was created.

            </p>

            <p class="font paragraph-text">
                The final step of the segmentation process was to take the threshold image, distance map, and maxima,
                and perform a watershed segmentation, which floods basins from the markers until basins attributed 
                to different markers meet on watershed lines, creating a segmented image of the original image. 
                The results of each step along with the final segmented image are shown in the paired image.

              After segmenting the image, utilizing Skimage's RegionProps functionality and analyzing each segmented region
              allowed for a list of properties and attributes for each region of the image to be generated. Among the list of
              obtained attributes were two crucial properties, size and the centroid coordinate of each segmented region. With 
              each slice of the CT scan, individual organs could be identified and tracked throughout the collective series 
              of images from the centroid coordinate of each segmented region. An

              For each segmented region of every slice in the CT scan, the centroid coordinate was aligned from slice to slice,
              and as the individual organs were tracked throughout the series of scans, the size of each segmentation was collected and tallied. 
              From accumulating the size of each segmented region, a total size of each organ was able to be determined, and
